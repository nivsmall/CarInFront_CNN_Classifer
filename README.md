# A Python-TensorFlow Implementation for an Image Classification Model

Using self-labeled data

# Requirements:
  - Python 3.7
  - TensorFlow2.XX
  - OpenCV (CV2)
  - Numpy
  - matplotlib


# Getting the data:
Free dataset available for download, Berkely Deep Drive:
  - Repository -- https://github.com/ucbdrive/bdd100k
  - Website -- https://bdd-data.berkeley.edu/

# Model Architecture:
Using a slimmer version of (an already slim) Alexnet
  - published Alexnet paper: https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf



# Own It!

Use your own data, self label it as you wish.

The repository can be used for any Image Classification task

# Skip the manual labeling:
Labeling has already being done, use Json file from used_labels folder

Skip to - write tf.record - line of code in main.py


### TODO: for non binary classification: change last layer's activation from sigmoid to softmax, change labeling format to one-hot encoding
