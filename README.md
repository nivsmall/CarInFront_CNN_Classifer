# A Python-TensorFlow Implementation for an Image Classification Model

Using self-labeled data

# Requirements:
  - Python 3.7
  - TensorFlow2.XX
  - OpenCV (CV2)
  - Numpy
  - matplotlib


# Getting the data:
Free dataset available for download, Berkely Deep Drive:
    Repository -- https://github.com/ucbdrive/bdd100k
    Website -- https://bdd-data.berkeley.edu/

# Model Architecture:
Using a slimmer version of (an already slim) Alexnet
                      - published Alexnet paper: https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf



This Repository can be used for any image classification task, including self labeling stage
